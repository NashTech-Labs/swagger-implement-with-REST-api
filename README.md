# Swagger API documentation 

Swagger is a simple but powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment. In January 1st 2016 the [Swagger Specification](http://swagger.io/) has been donated to the [Open API Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org/) and has been renamed to the [OpenAPI Specification](https://openapis.org/). With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. In this example you can see the documentation API in localhost adress:

```sh
http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
```
* As you can see Swagger provide a simple way to document US API's.
